If the icon appear in **red** like above. This mean that the simulator is not running. The app should have already notified that the simulator is not running like below.

+ // #![windows_subsystem = "windows"]
```

## Issues

‚ùå Setting the *AppUserModelID* work with the window-rs crate. See the branch *try-notif*. However no notification appear for some reasons... It could be required that the app need to be installed with something ? maybe an exe in a specified path with registration key

## What is currently displayed during a touchdown ?

- G Force
- Touchdown velocity in fpm
- Touchdown pitch deg (so far it's negative might need to invert the value)
- Touchdown heading
- Touchdown bank deg
